                <p>When I first started programming, I only knew how to use flexbox. So naturally, I only used flexbox. By no means did I think that flexbox was any better or any worse than CSS grid, I just never learned how to use it properly.</p>
                <p>Once I started to get more responsibilities at my job, I realized that maybe flexbox wasn’t always the go-to answer for every project. It was getting in the way with the different layouts that I was building and it was causing more trouble than it was worth.</p>
                <p>In this article, I’m going to lay out the differences between the flexbox and CSS grid. Then, I will discuss when the best use case for each is.</p>
